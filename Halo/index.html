                Pluto (134340 Pluto) is the largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System[11], a trans-Neptunian object, and the tenth most massive (excluding satellites) celestial body orbiting the Sun â€” after the eight planets and Eris[12][13][14]. Pluto was originally considered the ninth classical planet, but it is now considered a dwarf planet and the largest object in the Kuiper Belt (in particular, larger than Eris)[11].

Like most Kuiper Belt bodies, Pluto is made up mostly of rock and ice and is relatively small: its mass is less than the mass of the Moon by about 6 times, and its volume is about 3 times. The area of Pluto (17.7 million km2) is slightly larger than the area of Russia (17.1 million km2). Pluto's orbit has a large eccentricity and a large inclination to the plane of the ecliptic.

Due to the eccentricity of the orbit, Pluto is now approaching the Sun at a distance of 29.7 au (4.4 billion km), being closer to it than Neptune, then moving away at 49.3 au (7.4 billion km). Pluto and its largest moon Charon, discovered in 1978, are often considered a binary planet, since the barycenter of their system is located outside of both objects[15]. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has announced its intention to give a formal definition for binary dwarf planets, and until then Charon is classified as a satellite of Pluto[16][17]. Pluto has four other smaller moons:

Nycta and Hydra, discovered in 2005[18];
Kerber, first reported on July 20, 2011[19][19][20];
Styx, the discovery of which was announced on July 11, 2012[21].
From its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was considered the ninth planet in the Solar System. Soviet scientists in the 1950s suggested that Pluto is only the largest of the dwarf planets that orbit in this area of outer space in close orbits[22]. This hypothesis was brilliantly confirmed: at the end of the XX and the beginning of the XXI century, many objects were discovered in the outer Solar system. Notable among them are Quavar, Sedna, and especially Eris, which is 27 % more massive than Pluto[23], however, as established in 2015, Pluto is larger than Eris in size[24]. On August 24, 2006, the IAU first defined the term "planet". Pluto did not fall under this definition, and the IAU assigned it to a new category of dwarf planets, along with Eris and Ceres[25]. After the reclassification, Pluto was added to the list of minor planets and received the number 134340 in the catalog of the Minor Planet Center[26][27]. Some scientists continue to believe that Pluto should be reclassified back to a planet[28].

The Pluto system was previously studied by terrestrial and near-Earth astronomical means, and in 2015 was studied at close range by the American spacecraft "New Horizons" (New Horizons), which was launched when Pluto was considered an ordinary planet.

The chemical element plutonium was named after Pluto[29]:393.
